Here are the different versions of the files in this directory:

argtest.py				Testing argument passing in python

getRefpeaterInfo.py			This was the first test to try to get repeater data

getRefpeatersInfoCallSingle.py		This is the current starting poller, it loops through all
					repeaters and starts a new process to poll for each

getRefpeaterInfoSerial.py		This will get data from each repeater one at a time serially.
					All code is on this one file.

					to do the work.
